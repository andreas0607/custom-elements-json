> ⚠️ Very experimental and very unfinished

Custom-elements.json is a file format that describes custom elements. This format will allow tooling and IDEs to give rich information about the custom elements in a given project. It is, however, very experimental and things are subject to change. Follow the discussion [here](https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements-json).
