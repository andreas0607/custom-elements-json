  - [x] Mixins for functions that are JSDoc tagged to have mixins
  - [x] Link a Mixin to its package or modules. A mixin can either be imported, or it can be a declaration if its locally defined, so loop through imports and declarations and match it
    - Linking a Mixin's references happens after analyze phase
- [ ] Superclass - find if its locally declared or imported and add reference to it (similar to mixin implementation)
- [ ] Inheritance
- [ ] Implement Types for everything that can have a type
  - [ ] Loop through everything that can have a type and resolve it
